# thrust-rocketcurve-generator
Old code that was meant to generate raw data to measure the thrust of rocket motors using an Arduino, HX711, and a single strain gauge attached to a custom built scale meant to handle motot thrust. Requires the use of an old HX711 library (released 2018-2019?), check out [bodge's repo](https://github.com/bogde/HX711/releases) and try using versions prior to 7.4
